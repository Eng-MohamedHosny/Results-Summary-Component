# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component

## Overview
This is my solution to the **QR Code Component** challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).  
The goal of this challenge is to build a QR code card component as close as possible to the provided design.

## Built With
- HTML5  
- CSS3  

This project does **not** use JavaScript or any frameworks — just pure HTML and CSS.

---

## My Process
1. Planned the layout using semantic HTML elements.
2. Styled the component using CSS, focusing on:
   - Centering the card
   - Styling the QR image
   - Adding typography, padding, and rounded corners to match the design
3. Tested responsiveness and alignment manually based on the mobile design preview.

## What I Learned
- Practiced structuring a small UI component with HTML.  
- Practiced CSS layout, centering, and spacing.  
- Learned to match design specifications using only CSS (colors, border-radius, fonts, spacing).
